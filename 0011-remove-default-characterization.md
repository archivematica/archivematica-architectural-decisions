title: Removal of default characterization rule

## Context and problem statement

Archivematica is installed with default rules and commands for various preservation actions,
including characterization, which can be altered by an administrator through the Format
Policy Registry (FPR). In most cases, rules are set to run according to which format is 
ingested, but in the case of characterization, there has been a default, or a "fall back" 
rule, which is to run [FITS](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/fits) if a more specific rule
for that format doesn't exist. This ADR proposes to remove that default rule so that 
characterization is treated like other preservation actions.

## Decision drivers

* The primary decision driver is the maintenance of FITS itself and the lack of a 
  suitable replacement. FITS is a Java application and running it in a secure way
  in the Archivematica environment has been a challenge.
* Due to performance issues with FITS, it has been Artefactual System's recommendation on
  installation to have the command disabled for some time now. Therefore many Archivematica
  users are already not using FITS. 
* We have found that the approach of throwing a large, generalist tool at files and
  see "what sticks" has not been the most useful approach. In short, it results in 
  a large quantity of metadata written to the AIP METS files which is of limited
  utility (see [Issue 703](https://github.com/archivematica/Issues/issues/703) for
  discussion.)
* Our primary concern in the FPR now is to make it more maintainable and understandable.
  We are working toward a future state where changing rules, adding tools, changing
  commands, etc, is easier and therefore users will be better able to customize the FPR
  locally.
* While the universe of open source digital preservation tools is expansive, from consulting
  [COPTR](https://coptr.digipres.org/index.php/Tool_Functions) there doesn't appear to be
  a clear replacement for FITS. [Metadata extraction](https://coptr.digipres.org/index.php/Metadata_Extraction)
  appears to be the closest equivalent to characterization and most of the tools listed are
  best suited to specific file types. As per the point above, the intention should be that
  Archivematica users are more easily able to install and use these tools into the FPR
  should they so choose.
  

## Considered options

* Remove FITS from Archivematica codebase and do not replace
* Remove FITS from Archivematica codebase and replace with a different generalist
  characterization tool
* Maintain the status quo

## Decision outcome
